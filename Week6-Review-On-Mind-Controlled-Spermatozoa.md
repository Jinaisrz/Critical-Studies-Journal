>1. How is this computational, according to you?
>2. What topic is the piece/artist exploring, according to you?
>3. What other pieces of art are exploring a similar topic, and how are these pieces of art exploring the topic differently?
>4. Which parts/aspects/elements of this piece of art do you enjoy the most?
>5. Which parts (if any) could have been developed further, according to you?
>6. Which skills does the artist have that distinguish them from other artists?
>7. Does this piece inspire you? If so, how?
>8. What can you take away from this piece of art? How has studying this piece (potentially) changed your creative practice?
>9. Give context about the Prize and include information from the interviews with the artist that can be found on the website.  

>We hope that these questions will help you to engage with the art on a deeper level and to think about how it relates to the themes of the course.

"Mind Controlled Spermatozoa" by Anne Liu is a unique and thought-provoking piece of computational art that explores the intersection of technology and biology, challenging our traditional notions of control and power.

In using technology to control the movement of sperm through a virtual environment, this artwork incorporates computational elements. The piece also incorporates biofeedback and neuroscience, as the movements of the sperm are influenced by the thoughts and emotions of the artist, which are detected by EEG sensors. Through the use of various technological tools, the artist creates a unique interactive experience that blurs the boundaries between human and non-human entities.

The central theme of this work is to reflect on the cultural and scientific discourses that shape notions of the female body. This project challenges the status quo and creates an act of female empowerment in response to patriarchal regimes in which women's reproductive rights are challenged.     A woman controls something symbolically male: spermatozoa, in an expression of female empowerment.  Through the use of a brain-computer interface, she controls the movement of the sperm through the agency of her thoughts. 

Other works exploring similar themes include Eduardo Kac's "GFP Bunny," in which the artist genetically engineered a rabbit with a green fluorescent protein, and Stelarc's "Extra Ear," in which the artist implanted an ear-shaped prosthesis in his arm. But Liu's work is distinguished by its innovative use of biofeedback and neuroscience, and its integration of virtual and physical spaces.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of this work is the interactive component, as it allows the viewer to actively participate in the artwork and get involved in the creative process. The artist's ability to seamlessly integrate the virtual world and biofeedback mechanisms into the physical installation to create an immersive and engaging environment is also remarkable.

One aspect that could be further developed is the exploration of the ethical and social implications of this kind of technology, as it raises questions about the boundaries between human and nonhuman beings, as well as the ethics of the manipulation of living organisms for artistic purposes.

Liu's ability to incorporate technology and biological elements into her works, and her ability to create immersive and thought-provoking experiences, distinguish her from other artists.

It has inspired me to challenge traditional notions of control and power, and to consider the potential of technology and biology in artistic expression. It has also encouraged me to continue to explore how Art and Science intersect in my own creative practice.

"Mind Controlled Spermatozoa" was exhibited at the 2017 Ars Electronica Festival, and was the winner of the 2016 Lumen Prize for Art and Technology. In interviews, Liu has stated that the piece aims to challenge traditional gender roles and the power dynamics involved in reproducing, as well as to explore the potential of technology to create new ways of communicating and expressing. She has also expressed an interest in developing the work further, possibly investigating the use of other organisms and biofeedback mechanisms.
