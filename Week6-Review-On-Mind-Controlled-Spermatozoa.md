# Week 6: Review on "Mind Controlled Spermatozoa"
>Choose one piece of art that is relevant to the topics of “computation”, “digital innovation”, “technology”, or any other topic we have discussed in the course of this unit.We would like you to write a review and interpretation of this work by considering the following questions:
>1. How is this computational, according to you?
>2. What topic is the piece/artist exploring, according to you?
>3. What other pieces of art are exploring a similar topic, and how are these pieces of art exploring the topic differently?
>4. Which parts/aspects/elements of this piece of art do you enjoy the most?
>5. Which parts (if any) could have been developed further, according to you?
>6. Which skills does the artist have that distinguish them from other artists?
>7. Does this piece inspire you? If so, how?
>8. What can you take away from this piece of art? How has studying this piece (potentially) changed your creative practice?
>9. Give context about the Prize and include information from the interviews with the artist that can be found on the website.  

>We hope that these questions will help you to engage with the art on a deeper level and to think about how it relates to the themes of the course.

Ani Liu's "Mind Controlled Spermatozoa" is an innovative and provocative work of computational art that examines the nexus between technology and biology and questions our established ideas of power and control.

This artwork uses computational elements to manipulate the movement of sperm through a virtual environment. Since the movements of the sperm are influenced by the artist's thoughts and emotions, which are picked up by EEG sensors, the piece also incorporates biofeedback and neuroscience. The artist creates a distinctive interactive experience that obfuscates the distinction between human and non-human entities by utilising a variety of technological tools.

The reflection on the cultural and scientific discourses that influence ideas about the female body is the main theme of this work. In response to patriarchal regimes that restrict women's reproductive rights, this project upends the status quo and creates an act of female empowerment. In an act of female empowerment, a woman controls spermatozoa, a symbolically male entity. She uses a brain-computer interface to direct the sperm's movement with the help of her thoughts. 

Other works exploring related themes include Stelarc's "Extra Ear," in which the artist implanted a prosthetic ear in his arm, and Eduardo Kac's "GFP Bunny," in which the artist genetically modified a rabbit with a green fluorescent protein. However, Liu's work stands out for its creative application of neuroscience and biofeedback as well as its fusion of virtual and real spaces.

The interactive element of this piece is one of its most appealing features because it enables the viewer to actively engage with the artwork and participate in the creative process. It is also impressive how the artist was able to incorporate the virtual environment and biofeedback mechanisms into the physical installation to produce an immersive and interesting environment.

The investigation of the ethical and social ramifications of this type of technology, which raises issues regarding the distinction between humans and other living things and the ethics of manipulating living things for artistic purposes, is one area that could be further developed.

Liu sets herself apart from other artists with her ability to incorporate technological and biological elements into her creations as well as her capacity to produce immersive and thought-provoking experiences.

I've been motivated to question ingrained ideas of authority and control as well as the role that biology and technology might play in artistic expression. It has also inspired me to keep looking into the ways that art and science interact in my own creative work.

The 2016 Lumen Award for Art and Technology winner, "Mind Directed Spermatozoa," was displayed at the 2017 Ars Electronica Festival. Liu has claimed in interviews that the piece attempts to question stereotypical gender roles and the power dynamics associated with reproduction, as well as to investigate the possibilities for technology to develop new forms of expression and communication. She has also indicated a desire to advance the project, perhaps looking into the use of additional creatures and biofeedback systems.
