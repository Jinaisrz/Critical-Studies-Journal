# Week 3: A New Space Station
>Write a 500 word short story using what we learned from crip technoscience to imagine a new space station, one where difference is not erased but embraced. What does the technology look like on ths space station? How is the crew selected? What is valued in this process?

'Ableism' is a big part of what prevents people with disabilities from accessing space.
For a long time, national space agencies have chosen only the best of the best. There has been an internalised belief that people with disabilities are somehow inferior to 'normal people'.

Astronauts with disabilities have many advantages. For example, neuroplasticity. Research has shown that the brain rewires itself to give people with disabilities superpowers. Blind people, for example, develop extraordinary senses of hearing and touch. Amputees develop the ability to perform feats of strength and dexterity.
This will open up many different possibilities for research on the space station ü™ê.

In a future space station, all disabilities are anticipated and welcomed, and all disabled people thrive, regardless of their productivity. In advocating accessible futures, access should not be treated as a matter of technical compliance or rehabilitation, a simple technological fix or a checklist. Instead, it should be seen as collective, messy, experimental, frictional and generative. Accessible futures demand our interdependence.

All types of disability should be 'seen', whether visible or invisible üë©‚Äçü¶º.

Accroding to RPWD Act 2016, there are 21 types of disabilities. 
1. Blindness
2. Low-vision
3. Leprosy Cured Persons
4. Hearing Impairment
5. Locomotor Disability
6. Dwarfism
7. Intellectual Disability
8. Mental Illness
9. Autism Spectrum Disorder
10. Cerebral Palsy
11. Muscular Dystrophy
12. Chronic Neurological Conditions
13. Specific Learning Disabilities
14. Multiple Sclerosis
15. Speech and Language Disability
16. Thalassemia
17. Hemophilia
18. Sickle Cell Disease
19. Multiple Disabilities including Deaf-blindness
20. Acid Attack Victims
21. Parkinson‚Äôs disease

Space equipment was never designed for people with disabilities.

To increase inclusiveness, we could perhaps do this by adding Braille and sign language instructions; customising spacesuits and space station interiors for people with physical disabilities to meet their daily needs; redesigning lighting systems for people with hearing impairments; redesigning accessible colour systems for people with colour deficiency and colour blindness; designing accessible alarm and communication buttons for people with speech impairments; providing medication and psychological support for people with mental impairments, etc.

Based on the fact that many people with disabilities have sharper senses, as discussed earlier, perhaps we could incorporate more sensory feedback into the space station in addition to vision.

Could we apply integration of tactile pathways to the shuttles, or the use of sound or vibration to convey information? Or perhaps a wearable device or a astronaur suit having these built-in that senses noise, light and temperature? 

Not only would this help the visually impaired, but it would also benefit a larger number of other astronauts üë©‚ÄçüöÄ. For example, NASA astronaut Chris Hadfield made headlines in 2001 when cleaning fluid leaked into his visor and irritated his eyes, leaving him unable to see mid-spacewalk.
