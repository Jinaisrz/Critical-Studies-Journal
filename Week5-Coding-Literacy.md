# Week 5
> ## Before doing any text reading: Just simply take a moment to write/reflect about “What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?” 

### What is literacy?
Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen. It helps us communicate with others, express our thoughts and ideas, and learn new things.

- Reading means language comprehension and word reading.
- Writing includes transcription (spelling and handwriting) and composition (articulating and structuring ideas in speech before writing).

### What does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?
A reader who is familiar with the programming language can read the programmer's code.

The code typically contains words like if, else, define, switch, end, for, and others that English speakers may be familiar with.Programming languages are things that can be read by computers and can also be executed, or run, by them.
Programming is also somewhat similar to writing. To programme a machine to perform a desired action, people create a language with a predetermined grammar and logic.

An effective rhetorical framework can be the comparison of coding to literacy. As programming becomes increasingly complex, it becomes a component of a set of communication skills that are crucial in everyday life, and literacy expands as a result.
  

> ## After reading the assigned text: What are the new thoughts that come to you and help problematising the notion of coding literacy?  Which quotes or sentences inspire you to think more?

1. Extend the definition: Writing code is just one aspect of coding literacy, but it encompasses much more. Persuade people that coding is the capacity to comprehend, utilise, and assess technology and how it affects society.

2. Critical thinking: People can get a deeper grasp of coding by posing inquiries about its goal and its outcomes.

3. The capacity to analyse complicated structures: Decomposition requires the capacity to separate complex skeletons into smaller, more manageable pieces.

4. Writing highly integrated code in function libraries and calling it through interfaces. Those who work in different fields can quickly become up to speed with writing code in this way. They only need to call the proper function when they wish to employ an algorithm; they don't need to comprehend the intricate mechanics of how it operates. The code is also lot cleaner and simpler to comprehend as a result.

5. Improve code specifications: Write cleaner, easier-to-read code. This enhances team collaboration and makes it simpler for others to read the code.

6. Collaboration between multiple academic disciplines, such as computer science, education, sociology, and ethics, might assist challenge the idea of coding literacy. Together, they may investigate the various viewpoints and societal effects of coding literacy.

7. Research the historical and cultural background: By understanding how coding evolved and how it impacted society, people may have a more thorough understanding of the subject.

8. Promote diverse viewpoints: By bringing together individuals with various backgrounds and viewpoints, people may discuss the various effects that coding may have on society.

9. Recognize the social and cultural context: Coding proficiency is not solely a technical competence; it is also influenced by social and cultural aspects. Stimulate thought about how cultural values and power structures affect technology and code.

10. Make the codes more reliable and stable so they can function better and require less upkeep.

The followings are some quote that inspired me most:  
>Coding literacy is a form of power - a power to create, to invent, to shape, to change, and to transform.  

>Coding literacy is not just a set of technical skills, but also a way of thinking and understanding the world.  

>Live coding invites us to question and experiment with assumptions about computational practices and pedagogies, the situatedness of technology and its epistemological effects, and the politics of access and control in relation to code and culture.
