# Week 5
> ## Before doing any text reading: Just simply take a moment to write/reflect about “What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?” 

### What is literacy?
Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen. It helps us communicate with others, express our thoughts and ideas, and learn new things.

- Reading means language comprehension and word reading.
- Writing includes transcription (spelling and handwriting) and composition (articulating and structuring ideas in speech before writing).

### What does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?
The programmer's code is readable by a reader who understands the programming language.
The code usually contains words that may be recognisable to English speakers: if, else, define, switch, end, for, and others.
Programming languages are something that have real meanings in symbols that can be read and also executed, or run, by a computer.
At the same time, programming is to some extent writing. People write a language with a specific syntax and logic to make the computer do what they want it to do.
The analogy of coding as literacy can be an appropriate rhetorical framework. Computer programming becomes part of a set of communication skills that are important in everyday life, and literacy becomes more expansive as programming becomes more sophisticated.
  

> ## After reading the assigned text: What are the new thoughts that come to you and help problematising the notion of coding literacy?  Which quotes or sentences inspire you to think more?

1. Broaden the definition: Coding literacy is often seen as the ability to write code, but it's much more than that. Encourage others to see coding as the ability to understand, use and critically evaluate technology and how it affects society.

2. Critical thinking: By asking questions about the purpose and potential consequences of coding, people can gain a deeper understanding of the subject.

3. The ability to analyse complex structures: Decomposition involves the ability to dissect complex skeletons and the ability to reduce these skeletons to more manageable proportions.

4. Highly integrated code: Write highly integrated code in function libraries and then call them with interfaces. In this way, people who are working in other areas can also get up to speed with writing code in a short time. They don't need to understand the complex mechanics of how algorithms work, they just need to call the appropriate function when they want to use it. This also makes the code much cleaner and easier to read.

5. Develop better code specifications: Make the code more elegant and readable. This makes it easier for others to read the code and improves team collaboration.

6. Interdisciplinary collaboration: Bringing together people from different backgrounds, such as computer science, education, sociology and ethics, can help problematise the notion of coding literacy. Together they can explore the different perspectives and societal implications of coding literacy.

7. Examine the historical and cultural context: Through an understanding of the development of coding and its impact on society, people can have a more nuanced understanding of the subject.

8. Encourage diverse perspectives: People can explore the different ways in which coding can impact on society by bringing together people with different experiences and perspectives.

9. Be aware of the social and cultural context: The ability to code is not just a technical skill, but one that is also shaped by social and cultural factors. Encourage reflection on how technology and coding is affected by power dynamics and cultural values.

10. Make the codes more robust and stable, so that they can work better and are easier to maintain.

The followings are some quote that inspired me most:  
>Coding literacy is a form of power - a power to create, to invent, to shape, to change, and to transform.  

>Coding literacy is not just a set of technical skills, but also a way of thinking and understanding the world.  

>Live coding invites us to question and experiment with assumptions about computational practices and pedagogies, the situatedness of technology and its epistemological effects, and the politics of access and control in relation to code and culture.
