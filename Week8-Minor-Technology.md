A growing number of community-based projects and minor/small technology initiatives that go against BigTech's prevailing paradigms have gained attention in recent years. These initiatives seek to provide more sustainable and fair technologies that are built and maintained by their users. For example, https://alexandria.anarchaserver.org/index.php/ offers a compelling alternative to the centralized, growth-oriented technologies that dominate the mainstream.

The essay "A Pluriverse of Local Worlds: A Survey of Computing within Limits—Related Terms and Techniques" by Marloes de Valk offers a helpful framework for comprehending the importance of these kinds of undertakings. She makes the case that computing within constraints is a method to reconsider how technology interacts with the environment and emphasises the significance of small-scale actions that put sustainability and social justice first. The projects showcased on anarchaserver.org are a prime example of this kind of thinking, as they are designed to serve the needs of a particular community, rather than the interests of corporate entities.

The concept of the "Fediverse," which Aymeric Mansoux and Roel Roscam Abbing explore in their work "Seven Theses on the Fediverse and the Becoming of FLOSS," is another pertinent idea that can aid us in comprehending the relevance of these kinds of projects. A decentralised network of social media sites called the Fediverse uses open protocols to let people share and communicate across many platforms. This strategy contrasts with corporate social media platforms' centralised models, which are created to maximise profit for their owners rather than meet the demands of their users. A more diverse and democratic network culture can be produced by decentralisation and interoperability, as seen in the Fediverse.

The initiatives featured on anarchaserver.org are a part of a larger effort to build alternative, decentralised networks that put the demands of people ahead of business objectives. There is a need for technologies that are designed to be "affective infrastructures," that is, technologies that are embedded in social and emotional relationships rather than just designed for efficiency or profit, as Nate Wessalowski, Mara Karagianni, ooooo, and Yo Ezn argue in their essay "Inhabiting affective infrastructures: How not to scale a feminist video platform". The initiatives on anarchaserver.org are based on the values of solidarity and caring, and they seek to build communities where users may interact and work together in powerful ways.

In conclusion, small-scale technology provides an alternative to the dominant narrative of technological progress that is dominated by large corporations. These practices prioritize community ownership, sustainability, and social justice, and challenge the growth mindset that underpins the tech industry. However, it is important to note that small-scale technology is not a panacea for all of the problems associated with big tech, and there are limits to its scalability. As de Valk notes, “we need to remain aware of the limitations of these alternative, minor practices and not simply glorify them as an alternative to the BigTech status quo” (de Valk, 2022).
