The link https://alexandria.anarchaserver.org/index.php/You_can_check_some_of_their_services_in_this_section provides numerous illustrations of small-scale, neighborhood-based initiatives that operate outside of the dominant technological paradigm. These initiatives frequently use alternative technologies that have been created by the communities themselves to address a particular social or political issue. Alternative search engines, social networks, online libraries, and art galleries are all part of the efforts. Despite the fact that these initiatives are tiny in scope, they frequently have a significant influence on the communities they serve.

The idea of small-scale technology is closely related to the concept of "computing within limits," which refers to "a set of practises and discourses that promote a critical engagement with the environmental, social, and economic impacts of computing." 2022 (De Valk) Computing within boundaries highlights the need to create technology that is accessible, fair, and sustainable rather than relying solely on the dominating tech sector to address societal issues. People can take control of their technical infrastructure and mould it to serve their own interests by creating small-scale technologies that are tailored to the demands of particular communities.

The "Anarchaserver," a server that houses a number of services for anarchist and feminist societies, is one illustration of a small-scale project referenced in the link. A group of volunteers manages the Anarchaserver, which offers a number of features like chat, file sharing, and email. An example of how small-scale technology can be used to assist underserved communities and give them a place to organise and communicate without relying on big tech companies is the Anarchaserver.
