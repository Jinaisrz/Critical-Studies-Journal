The link https://alexandria.anarchaserver.org/index.php/You_can_check_some_of_their_services_in_this_section provides numerous illustrations of small-scale, neighborhood-based initiatives that operate outside of the dominant technological paradigm. These initiatives frequently use alternative technologies that have been created by the communities themselves to address a particular social or political issue. Alternative search engines, social networks, online libraries, and art galleries are all part of the efforts. Despite the fact that these initiatives are tiny in scope, they frequently have a significant influence on the communities they serve.

The "Anarchaserver," a server that houses a number of services for anarchist and feminist societies, is one illustration of a small-scale project referenced in the link. A group of volunteers manages the Anarchaserver, which offers a number of features like chat, file sharing, and email. An example of how small-scale technology can be used to assist underserved communities and give them a place to organise and communicate without relying on big tech companies is the Anarchaserver.

These initiatives all place a strong emphasis on localism and sustainability in some way. As De Valk (2022) writes, "Computing within Limits is an interdisciplinary research field that aims to understand and critique the relationship between computing technologies and their environmental, economic, and social impacts." This is consistent with the philosophy of many of the initiatives included in the assigned readings, which places a higher priority on low-impact, long-term solutions than the relentless pursuit of development and expansion that is typical of many major technical platforms.

Another theme that emerges from these projects is the desire to create alternative modes of communication and community-building.  For instance, the Fediverse, which Mansoux and Roscam Abbing (2020) define as "a network of servers that connect with each other via open protocols, giving an alternative to commercial social media and silos," is the foundation of the decentralised social network Mastodon.

Last but not least, a lot of these initiatives are driven by a desire to oppose established power structures and provide disadvantaged perspectives a platform. An illustration of this is the feminist video platform mentioned in the essay by Wessalowski et al. (2023). The platform aspires to establish a secure and encouraging space for these views to be heard while giving priority to the experiences and opinions of women and other oppressed groups.

Overall, these projects show how minor/small technology has the power to influence meaningful change within the computing industry and beyond. As De Valk (2022) writes, "Computing within Limits...calls for an approach that acknowledges the diversity of human and non-human perspectives, that is aware of the cultural, political and economic embeddedness of technology, and that acknowledges the agency of people in shaping the technological systems they use." By prioritising sustainability, community-building, and marginalised voices, these projects offer a vision of technology that is more ethical, equitable, and humane than the dominant paradigm.
