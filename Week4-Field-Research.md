# Week 4
>## What impression does the exhibition give you? How do you feel?
It is an exhibition filled with playful, curious and poetic objects that uncover the rich history of Surrealism and its fascinating influence on design.
I marveled at these surprising and humorous objects in the exhibition.

>## Analyse the exhibition: Look at the selection of objects, the organization of display, the objects, and the overall narrative of the exhibition. Reflect on how the curation shapes your understanding of the subject matter.  

### Selection of objects:
The exhibition offers a sweeping panorama of the interactions between Surrealism and design over the past 100 years, including sculpture, drawing, photography, and design. From world-renowned works by Surrealist pioneers like Salvador Dalí and Leonora Carrington to contemporary artists and designers like Schiaparelli, Dior, Björk.

### Organization of display:
The exhibition is divided into four themes. 

It begins with an introduction to Surrealism in the 1920s, exploring how the movement influenced everyday objects as well as its central role in shaping design throughout the twentieth century.

Another part of the exhibition explores Surrealism and interior design, as early protagonists of the movement were interested in capturing the aura or mystery of everyday household objects. They used Surrealist art as a source of ideas to create humorous objects that surprised people.

Another section of the exhibition is devoted to Surrealism and the body as it relates to the human form, sexuality, and desire.
Included in this section are Sarah Lucas' Cigarette Tits and Najla el Zein's Hay.
Photographs, vintage magazine covers, and fashion items are displayed to show how Surrealism influenced the fashion industry beginning in the 1930s.

The final section of the exhibition explores Surrealism's preoccupation with questioning the creative process itself. How this led to original works of art and design.

### Objects: 
The objects featured in the exhibition are of the highest quality, and many are considered masterpieces of Surrealism. The exhibition brings together the best of Surrealist design, including furniture, interiors, fashion, photography, and world-renowned artworks by Surrealist pioneers such as Salvador Dalí's Lobster Telephone, Duchamp's Porte-Bouteilles, and Man Ray's Cadeau. The works are presented in a way that allows the viewer to appreciate their beauty as well as their technical and formal qualities. The use of light and space is also effective in highlighting the works of art and in creating a sense of awe at the achievement of the artist.

### Overall narrative: 
At the heart of the exhibition's overall narrative is Surrealism's contribution to the development of modern art and design. On the one hand, the exhibition offers a new reading of Surrealism, showing how the movement had an impact on people's everyday lives far beyond the boundaries of art. On the other hand, it presents a highly topical view of contemporary design and reveals an important source of its inspiration. The exhibition effectively starts a conversation about what Surrealism is and why it matters now.

### Conclusion
The "Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924 – Today" at Design Museum is a well-curated and thoughtfully organized exhibition that provides a comprehensive overview of the artists' works and achievements. The selection of objects, the organization of display, the objects themselves, and the overall narrative are all of high quality and effectively communicate Surrealism's significance as a major genre in the history of modern art.
