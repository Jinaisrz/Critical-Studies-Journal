# Week 4: Field Research
>## What impression does the exhibition give you? How do you feel?
The show explores the rich history of surrealism and its interesting influence on design through a variety of whimsical, inquisitive, and poetic items.

I was in awe of these intriguing and amusing exhibit items.

>## Analyse the exhibition: Look at the selection of objects, the organization of display, the objects, and the overall narrative of the exhibition. Reflect on how the curation shapes your understanding of the subject matter.  

### Selection of objects:
Using sculpture, drawing, photography, and design, the show provides a comprehensive overview of the interactions between Surrealism and design throughout the past century. From the well-known creations of early Surrealists like Salvador Dali and Leonora Carrington through modern designers and artists like Schiaparelli, Dior, and Björk.

### Organization of display:
Four themes make up the division of the exhibition.

It starts with an introduction to Surrealism in the 1920s, looking at how the movement affected common things and how important it was to the development of design in the 20th century.

The relationship between Surrealism and interior design is also explored in this section of the show, as early Surrealists were drawn to the aura or mystique of commonplace household items. They drew inspiration from Surrealism art to produce amusing items that astonished onlookers.

The show also includes a section on Surrealism and the body in relation to human form, sexuality, and desire.This section contains the works Cigarette Tits by Sarah Lucas and Hay by Najla el Zein.To demonstrate how Surrealism had an impact on the fashion business starting in the 1930s, images, old magazine covers, and clothing are on display.

The exhibition's last segment examines Surrealism's obsession with challenging the creative process itself. how this produced unique pieces of art and design.

### Objects: 
The exhibit's pieces are of the greatest calibre, and several of them are regarded as Surrealist classics. The best examples of surrealist design are showcased in this exhibition, including Man Ray's Cadeau, Lobster Telephone by Salvador Dali, Porte-Bouteilles by Marcel Duchamp, and Porte-Bouteilles by Marcel Duchamp. The paintings are displayed so that the visitor can recognise both their aesthetic appeal and their formal and technical merits. Very useful at drawing attention to the works of art and inspiring wonder in the viewer at the artist's accomplishments is the use of light and space.

### Overall narrative: 
The central theme of the exhibition's overarching story is Surrealism's influence on the creation of modern art and design. On the one hand, the exhibition provides a fresh interpretation of surrealism by demonstrating how its influence extended well beyond the realm of art and affected people's daily lives. On the other hand, it offers a very current perspective on modern design and identifies a significant inspiration. The show successfully launches a discussion about what Surrealism is and why it is relevant now.

### Conclusion
The "Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924 – Today" at Design Museum is a well-curated and thoughtfully organized exhibition that provides a comprehensive overview of the artists' works and achievements. The selection of objects, the organization of display, the objects themselves, and the overall narrative are all of high quality and effectively communicate Surrealism's significance as a major genre in the history of modern art.
