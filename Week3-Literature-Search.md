# Week3: Literature Search
In my years of gaming experience, I have noticed that gender bending is a popular activity in both offline and online games. Games allow players to construct and rehearse a range of identities. So in my essay, I want to explore the motivations behind this phenomenon.

I'm new to the subject, so I'd start by looking for some introductory books üîç.

## Record of Searches

## How I Revised my Search Terms
I started with ***[gender bending]*** in UAL library, but got few related results.

Because this topic is also related to gender performativity, I also came across the terms ***[Butler gender performativity]*** and found some really helpful introductory books on her work.

Then I tried ***[Gender identyty games]*** in Google Scholar. However, I found that such search results did not quite match what I was looking for; they were very broad and many were about other issues. Perhaps gender identity is a bigger issue and there are many studies that mention it. This tells me that I need to narrow my search and make it more relevant.

I also came across the terms ***[gender bending games]***,  ***[gender swapping games]*** and ***[gender performativity games]*** and found lots of related essays. But I noticed that a number of articles related to sports competitions also appear in the search results. Perhaps because "games" also means sportsüèÄ.

So I finally tried to narrow down the scope of ***[games]*** even further. I changed it into ***[video games]*** and found that it worked well.

Since I mainly wanted to work on online multiplayer games, I tried ***[gender bending MMORPG games]*** and it turned out well.
