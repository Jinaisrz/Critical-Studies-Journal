# Week7: Posthumanism and Transhumanism
>## Write a blog about Viktoria Modesta and discuss whether you consider her as a posthumanism or transhumanism artist. Back up your opinion with evidence from Viktoria Modesta's music video called Prototype  

Viktoria Modesta is a singer, composer, and performance artist of Latvian descent who has won acclaim throughout the world for her innovative approach to both music and dress. During Modesta's delivery, her leg was hurt. She elected to get it removed in 2007. Her stunning appearance and usage of prosthetic limbs, which she has incorporated into both her music videos and live performances, are what originally attracted attention to her.
  
A significant movement known as posthumanism contests the notion that people are a distinct and natural category. It implies that technology, genetics, and other forms of human intervention are causing humans to constantly change and evolve. The humanist tradition, which gives human values and ideals precedence over all other forms of life, is frequently attacked by posthumanism. Contrarily, transhumanism is a more focused and upbeat perspective that sees technology as a way to expand human potential and get past physical constraints. In order to create a better and newer version of humanity, it seeks to use technology to overcome the problems of mortality, disease, and ageing. 

In the music video for "Prototype," Viktoria plays a futuristic cyborg with a prosthetic leg that can be used as a weapon and a striking white outfit. The video's overall atmosphere of unease and tension is heightened by the stark, clinical setting and the use of medical apparatus. The desire to transcend human limitations and norms is expressed in the song's lyrics as well as the desire to become something other than human.
  
Modesta's interest in using technology to improve her physical capabilities and push the envelope of what is conceivable are characteristics of transhumanism. Her work does, however, also contain elements of posthumanism, particularly in the way she questions conventional notions of femininity and the human body. 

For instance, Modesta breaks glass with her prosthetic leg in the music video to demonstrate her strength and power. This clearly rejects the conventional view of women as frail and delicate and instead presents a new vision of femininity that is strong, brave, and unapologetic. In a similar vein, Modesta's use of prosthetics suggests that we are capable of modifying and transforming ourselves in novel and exciting ways, challenging the notion that the human body is fixed and unchangeable.

Viktoria Modesta's work undoubtedly contains elements of transhumanism, but her emphasis on questioning conventional gender roles and the physical limitations of the human body leads one to believe that she is more closely associated with the posthumanist movement. Modesta pushes the boundaries of what is conventionally considered to be human by utilising technology, encouraging us to consider novel possibilities for the future of humanity.
