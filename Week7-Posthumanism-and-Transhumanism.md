# Week7: Posthumanism and Transhumanism
>## Write a blog about Viktoria Modesta and discuss whether you consider her as a posthumanism or transhumanism artist. Back up your opinion with evidence from Viktoria Modesta's music video called Prototype  

Viktoria Modesta is a Latvian-born singer, songwriter, and performance artist who has gained international recognition for her avant-garde approach to music and fashion. Modesta's leg was injured during her birth. She had it voluntarily amputated in 2007. She first gained attention for her striking appearance and use of prosthetic limbs, which she has incorporated into her music videos and live performances.  
  
Posthumanism is a broad movement that challenges the idea that humans are a fixed and natural category. It suggests that humans are constantly evolving and transforming through technology, genetics, and other forms of intervention. Posthumanism is often critical of the humanist tradition, which prioritizes human values and ideals over other forms of life. Transhumanism, on the other hand, is a more specific and optimistic view that sees technology as a means to enhance human capabilities and transcend the limitations of the human body. It aims to use technology to overcome the challenges of mortality, disease, and aging, and to create a new and improved version of humanity.  

Her music video "Prototype" features Modesta as a futuristic cyborg, complete with a striking white outfit and a prosthetic leg that doubles as a weapon. The stark, clinical setting and the use of medical equipment add to the overall sense of unease and tension in the video. The lyrics of the song describe the desire to break free from societal norms and limitations, to become something more than human. 
  
Modesta is clearly interested in using technology to enhance her body and push the boundaries of what is possible, which are elements of transhumanism. However, there are also elements of posthumanism in her work, particularly in the way she challenges traditional ideas of femininity and the human body.  

For example, to emphasize her strength and power, Modesta uses her prosthetic leg to break through glass in the music video. This presents a new vision of femininity that is strong, bold, and unapologetic, a clear rejection of the traditional idea of women as fragile and delicate. In a similar vein, Modesta's use of prosthetics challenges the idea that the human body is fixed and unchangeable, and suggests that we are capable of modifying and transforming ourselves in new and exciting ways.  

Overall, while there are certainly elements of transhumanism in the work of Viktoria Modesta, her focus on challenging traditional gender roles and the limitations of the human body suggests that she is more closely aligned with the posthumanist movement. Through the use of technology, Modesta pushes the boundaries of what is traditionally thought of as human, inviting us to imagine new possibilities for the future of humankind.
